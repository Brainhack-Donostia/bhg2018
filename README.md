## BrainHack Materials
Here, we are adding the download links for different materials you are going to need to go through different activities and talks we are organizing for you:

### Virtual Machine
* First and foremost, to avoid wasting our time in installation of software and dealing with compatibility issues on many different operating systems, we have created two different virtual machines that you can choose from, depending on the sessions that you want to attend:
	* ~[ubuntu 16.04 (~8GB)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1koBn7u_Tgdk7-pTMWvqKimKRd5ArdFPE?usp=sharing), with all Python libraries installed, this is perfect for the first day~, and
	* [ubuntu 16.04 (~10GB)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NVSNP--MPWLiJDeSatw7WPuVPtGUoBew), with all software except for MATLAB and FieldTrip.

### Day 1
* All the materials that you are going to need *for NIRS and MEG sessions* have been uploaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rJE7pCIAXI_Zk0yXVERBA-Dai3_FGrQW).
* And those that you are going to need for `python` and `git` sessions are [here](python/) and [here](git-and-github/).
