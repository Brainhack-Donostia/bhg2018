# Python Tutorial

## Authors: 
* Dana Scarinci, and
* Usman Ayub Sheikh

## Goals
* This is a *quick* and *brief* introduction to Python; so,
* for those with some experience of programming in some other language, the goal is to show how to do the same things as you do in MATLAB now in Python? 
* For those with no experience of programming however, we might be able to: 
	- equip ourselves with some useful programming terminology/vocabulary, and 
	- learn about a few useful resources that we can later on go back to and learn more from.

## Topics
* [Python as a Language](python-as-a-language),
* [Data Types](data-types),
* [Arithmetic, and Logical Operators](arithmetic-and-logical-operators),
* [Strings](strings),
* [Conditionals](conditionals),
* [Loops](loops), and
* [Functions](functions).

### Python as a Language
* Python is a *high-level* language and therefore allows us to think and program more in terms of the task/operation we want to achieve rather than how and where the the bits and bytes of our data would actually get operated on, and stored. 
* Python is a *general purpose* language; so, its useful not just for scientific and numeric computing but can be applied to a range of different types of problems including those related to game development, web applications, desktop graphical user interfaces, e-commerce systems, and even hardware testing.
* Python is a *free* and *open source* language; so, it's continually evolving and is quite stable.
* One single important feature that makes it accessible and easy to learn, even for the newbies, is its *readability*; if Python code is well-written, you can make sense of it just by looking at it.
