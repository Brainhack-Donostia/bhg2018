# Python Tutorial

## Authors: 
* Dana Scarinci, and
* Usman Ayub Sheikh

## Goals
* For those with experience of programming in some other language, the goal would be to show how to do the same things as you do in MATLAB now in Python? 
* For those with no experience of programming however, what we can achieve in this tutorial is: 
	- to equip you with some programming terminology/vocabulary, 
	- give you a few example scripts and use cases, and 
	- point you to a few useful resources that you can later on learn from.

## Topics
* Python as a Language,
* Data Types,
* Data Structures,
* Arithmetic, and Logic Operators,
* Conditionals,
* Loops, and
* Functions.
